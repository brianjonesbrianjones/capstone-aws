## Project Workflow

### Web Application Update

I made two changes to the main index.html page. I changed the title from "Full Stack Academy" to "Wyld Rides" and a section title from "Sign Up" to "Ride with Us!"

### Version Control and Code Management

After cloning the repository to my local machine from Jamal's github I then removed the original orgin. I then set the orgin to a newly created repository under my own GitHub account and push all the project files up to that repository.
